# avalanche2

## About this file
This is the readme file for my project hosted at (danieltuzes/avalanhe2)[https://github.com/danieltuzes/avalanche2]. This file is manually created by me and contains some description of this project.
## About this repo
Here you can find my simulations programs and evaluation programs to analyize the data you get. I wrote these during my PhD years.
### names
This project is called avalanche2, but there is no avalanche1 or avalanche, it has been removed long ago. avalanche2 is the CA model written to study dislocation avalanches under mean field approximation and avalanche3 is the CA model written to study dislocation patterns.
## so many projects, folders and main files
Here you can find all the folders listed with my programs therein. Each folder contains a program for specific purposes.

  1: avalanche2: The dislocation avalanche simulation program. It is based on the continuum model of dislocations in mean field approximation.
  
  2: correlation_integral: to calculate the correlation integrals of the initial point of dislocation avalanches
